# OS Assignment 2

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for Assignment 2. In this assignment, we are tasked with implementing the **timer_sleep** function as described in the **Pintos** documentation. Additionally, we need to create documentation similar to the format found in Pintos reference manual.
